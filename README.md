This repo try to document the information about Router/Switch, its chipset and some other details based on various sources. 
This is started based on my note collection in last few years, so some data may not be 100% accurate, so please always do your resarch and double check. 

If you see anything wrong/inaccurate, just let me know or create issue/PR.
I am also open for any contribution, feel free to create PR to add/modify the data, just please do not add anything that under NDA or anything not public.
